  <h1>Common Wine Vocabulary</h1>
  <div id="Vocab-List">
    <h2>Acidity</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Acid is a naturally occurring component in all wines, some just have higher amounts
  than others and are more noticeable. But this is not a bad thing. Wines that are grown
  in cooler areas will have a higher amount of Malic acid in the final product. Contrary to
  warmer growing regions (Spain, Portugal, Central Italy), they are going to have less
  acidity in the wine creating a richer characteristic. When explaining what this means to
  guests, we want to stay away from words like acid in wine because this does not sound
  appetizing. You want to use words like bright or vibrant. For example, you could say
  that a Sancerre is a bright, young white wine.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tannin</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Tannins are found in the skins, stems, and seeds of grapes and are most noticeable in
  large red wines. This is because you are letting the juice sit on the skins when
  fermenting for red wines to all for color extraction as well. Wines like Cabernet
  Sauvignon, Malbec, Nebbiolo from Northern Italy, all have higher amounts of tannins in
  the wine. What tannins do on the palate is they create a drying sensation on your gums.
  It absorbs the moisture in your mouth and almost gives you a cotton mouth feeling.
  Note that white wines can have some tannins, but it is extremely uncommon.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Body</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>When somebody says they want a full-bodied wine they are talking about the weight of
  the wine. Typically, they want a large red wine to go with their dinner. Good examples
  of this are Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Merlot, and for white California Chardonnay
  (MLF again). Think of the different styles of milk as the body. A light body wine would
  feel like skim milk on the palate, medium bodied is whole milk, and full bodied is closer
  to heavy cream.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Legs</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Everybody’s favorite thing to talk about, because it is one of the few things that you can
  physically see with wine. Legs are caused by fluid surface tension when the alcohol is
  evaporating. They can indicate the alcohol content in a wine, but this is not a sure-fire
  way to determine as temperature as well as humidity can influence them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sweetness</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>“I like a sweet, full bodied, red wine” …… so port? No, they want a full-bodied wine. This
  is because wines that taste fruit forward, the guest is associating that with sweetness.
  When they start tasting ripe fruit in their wine, their brain says to them, that tastes like
  a plum, and plums are sweet so this wine must also be sweet. In fact, there is little to no
  sugar left over from the fermentation process.</li>
    </ul>
